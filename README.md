Bubble Sort Ruby Project

This exercise is meant to practice creating a method for sorting items in an array to put each item in ascending order from left to right. The method used in this exercise is a less efficient method in which the items in the list are iterated over multiple times, moving an item from right to left if it is lower in value until everything is sorted via trial and error.
